# This website is for the Doing Data Science for SMU Masters in Data Science. 



### Hey There!  I am originally from the Northeast.  Some of my interests include sports, hanging with my dog, and looking for the perfect pizza slice or bagel.  I am currently a Data Analyst for a health tech company and proudly represent the The University of Texas.  



### The other tabs represent the work / analyses I have completed.  Please check them out!
